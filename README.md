# Full Stack JavaScript Project 3

Forms are essential in the world of websites and in this project I created a form that goes to the next level.  Some of the features include:

* A Job Role "other" that adds a form field for the user to type in their role
* T-Shirt Colors only appear when a design is selected and is appropriate for that specific design
* Activities unobtrusively add total cost to the bottom and identify/disable items that correlate in time/day
* Payment method defaults to credit, but when changed shows appropriate information below
* All fields "required" have error messaging if not filled properly and are connected to a regex to ensure proper entry
